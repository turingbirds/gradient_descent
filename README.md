Visualisation of optimisation algorithms
========================================

Written as part of an invited talk at the Aspects of Neuroscience BrainHack 2017, Warsaw, Poland.

Sebiastian Ruder has written an excellent paper [1] and blog post [2] about many different optimisation algorithms, but I couldn't find any associated code, while wanting to try the algorithms on other cost functions, tweak the parameters and observe first-hand how the different methods compare; hence this notebook.
